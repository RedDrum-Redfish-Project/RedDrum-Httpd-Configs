--Gevent WSGI Interface
    -- To be provided
    -- Gevent does not have a full reverse proxy but does support standard WSGI interface
    -- Integrating with Gevent is under development for use on OpenBMC implementations that do not want
       to include the overhead of a full httpd server eg Apache or NGNX.
