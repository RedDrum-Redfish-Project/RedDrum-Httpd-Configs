# Apache httpd config  script:
# This script creates self-signed certificates, and sets up working httpd.conf and ssl.conf files used by httpd for centos 7.1

# create the HTTPS SSL keys and certs
   # Step-0: set RMSSLCERTS to path to certs we are creating
   SSLCERTS=./sslCerts

   # Step-1: Generagte private ssl key
   #   this creates the ca.key file
   openssl genrsa -out ${SSLCERTS}/ca.key 2048

   # Step-2: Generate CSR
   #   this creates the ca.csr file from the ca.key
   openssl req -new -key ${SSLCERTS}/ca.key -out ${SSLCERTS}/ca.csr \
