# STEPS TO ENABLE HTTPS on Apache Centos 7 httpd:
#
# NOTE: these steps are executed by the SubSystem_config.sh in the directory above this directory
#
# Step-1:
#    verify you have mod_ssl in apache
#    if not, install it: yum install mod_ssl openssl

# Step-2:
#    generate the SSL keys and certificates
#    creates a self-signed cert for the serivce and saves to  ./sslCerts
CFGPROFILE=`pwd`
cd ${CFGPROFILE}/sslCerts

# Step-2a:
#    generagte private ssl key
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048

# Step-2b:
#    generate CSR
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr

#  see the RMConfig httpd config script -- this is executed non-interactively there

# Step-2c:
#    generate Self Signed Key
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt

# Step-3:
#    copy ssl certs/keys to native location Apache uses
#    Note: the /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt and .../private/localhost.key files
#          are created by the post install of mod_ssl and should already be there.
#          Otherwise, they can be created similarly
cp ${CFGPROFILE}/sslCerts/ca.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
cp ${CFGPROFILE}/sslCerts/ca.key /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
cp ${CFGPROFILE}/sslCerts/ca.csr /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.csr

# Step-4:
#    configure httpd.conf VirtualServer for HTTPS:
#    Note: this is included in the httpd.conf file setup by SubSystem_config.sh, subsys httpd
<VirtualServer *:443>
SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key

# Step-5:
#    set SELinux bools to allow httpd to forward
#       the -P makes it persistent
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
